# Statamic MCP Guidelines

This file provides AI assistants with comprehensive understanding of the Statamic MCP Server capabilities and best practices.

## MCP Server Overview

The Statamic MCP Server uses a revolutionary router-based architecture with 8 powerful tools:

### Router Architecture (6 + 2 Tools)

**Domain Routers** (6 core tools consolidating 140+ operations):
- **statamic.content**: Unified content management (entries, terms, globals - 35+ ops)
- **statamic.structures**: Structural elements (collections, taxonomies, navigations, sites - 26+ ops)
- **statamic.assets**: Complete asset management (containers, files, metadata - 20+ ops)
- **statamic.users**: User and permission management (users, roles, groups - 24+ ops)
- **statamic.system**: System operations (cache, health, config, info - 15+ ops)
- **statamic.blueprints**: Schema management (CRUD, scanning, type generation - 10+ ops)

**Agent Education Tools** (2 specialized tools):
- **statamic.system.discover**: Intent-based tool discovery and recommendations
- **statamic.system.schema**: Detailed tool schema inspection and documentation

Use `statamic.system.discover` to find the right tool for your intent and `statamic.system.schema` for detailed documentation.

## Usage Patterns

### Discovery Phase
Always start development sessions with:
1. `statamic.system.discover` - Find the right tool for your intent
2. `statamic.system` (action: "info") - Understand the installation
3. `statamic.system.schema` - Get detailed tool documentation when needed
4. `statamic.structures` (action: "list", type: "collections") - Map content structure

### Development Phase
For content work:
- Use `statamic.content` with appropriate actions (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Use `statamic.structures` for collections, taxonomies, navigations
- Use `statamic.blueprints` for schema management and type generation

For system operations:
- Use `statamic.system` for cache management, health checks, configuration
- Use `statamic.assets` for file and media management
- Use `statamic.users` for user, role, and permission management

### Content Architecture
Create structures with appropriate router tools:

**Creating a Collection:**
Use `statamic.structures` with `{"action": "create", "type": "collection", "handle": "blog"}`

**Creating Blueprints:**
Use `statamic.blueprints` with `{"action": "create", "handle": "article", "fields": [...]}`

**Managing Entries:**
Use `statamic.content` with `{"action": "create", "type": "entries", "collection": "blog"}`

**Global Settings:**
Use `statamic.content` with `{"action": "update", "type": "globals", "set": "site_settings"}`

### Code Generation & Analysis
- Generate types with `statamic.blueprints` (action: "generate", type: "typescript")
- Use `statamic.system.discover` to find tools for specific development tasks
- Use `statamic.system.schema` to understand tool parameters and response formats

## Statamic Development Best Practices

### Primary Templating Language
Always consider the project's primary templating language when making suggestions:
- **Antlers-first projects**: Prefer Antlers syntax, use Antlers tags and variables
- **Blade-first projects**: Prefer Blade components, use Statamic Blade tags

### Template Language-Specific Patterns

#### Antlers Templates (Primary: Antlers)
1. **Use Antlers syntax**: `{{ title }}`, `{{ collection:articles }}`
2. **Field relationships**: `{{ author:name }}`, `{{ categories }}{{ title }}{{ /categories }}`
3. **Conditional logic**: `{{ if featured }}...{{ /if }}`
4. **Loops**: `{{ collection:blog }}{{ title }}{{ /collection:blog }}`
5. **Modifiers**: `{{ content | markdown }}`, `{{ date | format:Y-m-d }}`

#### Blade Templates (Primary: Blade)
1. **Use Statamic Blade tags**: `<s:collection>`, `<s:form:create>`
2. **Blade directives**: `@if`, `@foreach`, `@include`
3. **Components**: `<x-card>`, custom Blade components
4. **Avoid facades in views**: Use tags instead of `Entry::all()`
5. **Field access**: `{{ $entry->title }}`, `{{ $entry->author->name }}`

### Mixed Approach
- **Antlers for content templates**: Simple content display, loops, conditionals
- **Blade for complex logic**: Components, layouts, complex data processing
- **Never mix syntaxes in same template**: Choose one approach per template

### Content Architecture
1. **Blueprint-driven**: Design content structure first
2. **Relationship mapping**: Use entries, taxonomy, users appropriately
3. **Field type selection**: Match field types to content needs
4. **Validation rules**: Include appropriate validation

### Code Quality
1. **No inline PHP** in templates (both Antlers and Blade)
2. **No direct facades** in views (use Statamic tags)
3. **Proper error handling** for missing content
4. **Security considerations** for user input

## Field Type Reference

### Text Fields
- `text` - Single line text
- `textarea` - Multi-line text
- `markdown` - Markdown with preview
- `code` - Syntax highlighted code

### Rich Content
- `bard` - Rich editor with custom sets
- `redactor` - Alternative rich editor

### Media
- `assets` - File/image management
- `video` - Video embedding

### Relationships
- `entries` - Link to other entries
- `taxonomy` - Link to taxonomy terms
- `users` - Link to user accounts
- `collections` - Reference collections

### Structured Data
- `replicator` - Flexible content blocks
- `grid` - Tabular data
- `group` - Field grouping
- `yaml` - Raw YAML data

## AI Assistant Integration

When working with Statamic projects:

1. **Start with discovery** - Use `statamic.system.discover` to find the right tool for your task
2. **Use router tools** - Each domain router handles multiple related operations efficiently
3. **Check schemas** - Use `statamic.system.schema` for detailed parameter documentation
4. **Validate with real data** - Router tools provide current, accurate project state
5. **Follow router patterns** - Always use action-based syntax for consistent behavior

## Error Handling

All router tools provide consistent error responses. When tools return errors:
- Use `statamic.system.discover` to find the correct tool and action for your intent
- Use `statamic.system.schema` to verify parameter requirements and formats
- Check blueprints with `statamic.blueprints` (action: "scan")
- Validate project state with appropriate router tools

## Router Architecture Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: 8 tools instead of 140+ individual tools
- **Better Performance**: Consolidated operations with intelligent routing
- **Easier Discovery**: Intent-based tool finding with `statamic.system.discover`
- **Consistent Patterns**: All routers use action-based parameter syntax
- **Self-Documenting**: Built-in schema inspection with `statamic.system.schema`

This router architecture ensures AI assistants provide efficient, accurate, and scalable Statamic development assistance.


=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5.2
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- statamic/cms (STATAMIC) - v6
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- alpinejs (ALPINEJS) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(s). It is _always_ available through Laravel Herd.


=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia Core

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (vite.config.js).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use `search-docs` for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.

<code-snippet lang="php" name="Inertia::render Example">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>


=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 & v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features
- Polling
- Prefetching
- Deferred props
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`
- Lazy loading data on scroll

### Deferred Props & Empty States
- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing / animated skeleton.

### Inertia Form General Guidance
- Build forms using the `useForm` helper. Use the code examples and `search-docs` tool with a query of `useForm helper` for guidance.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== phpunit/core rules ===

## PHPUnit Core

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files, these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== statamic/cms rules ===

## Statamic
- This application uses Statamic.
- Statamic is an open source, PHP CMS designed and built specifically for developers and their clients or content managers.
- Out of the box, Statamic stores content in Markdown files. It's trivial to move into a database later, if necessary.
- Statamic comes in two flavours:
    - **Statamic Core** which is free to use, however you want, forever. It includes everything needed to build a blog or portfolio site.
    - **Statamic Pro** which includes everything from Core, as well as unlimited user accounts, revision history, multi-site, Git integration, white labelling and more. Tailored for most production websites.
    - For more information on pricing, please send the user to https://statamic.com/pricing.

### Folder Structure
Statamic is a Laravel package, meaning it can be used alone or alongside an existing Laravel application.

Most of the folder structure will feel familiar to Laravel developers. However, Statamic creates a few additional files and folders during the install process.


<code-snippet name="Folder Structure" lang="text">

├── bootstrap/
├── config/
│   ├── statamic/         # Statamic-specific configs

├── tests/
├── users/
├── please                # Statamic's CLI tool
├── ...
</code-snippet>


### Statamic's CLI
- Statamic ships with its own `please` CLI tool, useful for creating tags or fieldtypes, updating search indexes, enabling multi-site and much more.
- You may run `php please` to get the list of available commands. You may use the `--help` option on a command to inspect its required parameters.

### Statamic's Core Concepts
- **Assets:** Files managed by Statamic and made available to your writers and developers with tags and fieldtypes. They can be images, videos, PDFs, or any other type of file.
- **Collections:** Collections are containers that hold groups of related entries. Each entry in a collection can represent a blog post, product, recipe or page.
- **Globals:** Global variables store content that belongs to your whole site, not just a single page or URL. They're available everywhere, in all of your views, all the time.
- **Navigations:** A navigation is a hierarchy of links and text nodes that are used to build navs and menus on the frontend of your site.
- **Taxonomies:** A taxonomy is a system of classifying data around a set of unique characteristics. Think things like tags, categories, etc.
- **Users:** Users are the member accounts to your site or application. What a user can do with their account is up to you. They could have limited or full access to the Control Panel, a login-only area of the front-end, or even something more custom by tapping into Laravel.
- **Blueprints:** Blueprints determine the fields shown in your publish forms. You can configure the field's order, each field's width and group them into sections and tabs. Blueprints are attached to collections, taxonomies, globals, assets, users and even forms, all of which help to determine their content schema.
- **Fieldsets:** Fieldsets are used to store and organize reusable fields. Blueprints can reference fields or entire fieldsets, helping you keep your configurations nice and DRY.

### Templating
- Statamic supports two templating languages:
    - **Antlers** is tightly integrated and simple to learn. Uses the `.antlers.html` file extension.
    - **Laravel Blade** ships with Laravel and is familiar to most Laravel developers. Uses the `.blade.php` file extension.
- When creating views, you should familiarize yourself with the project and determine which templating language is already in use.
- When using Laravel Blade, you may want to use the "Antlers Blade Components" feature which lets you use a Blade-component-esque syntax with Statamic's tags feature:


<code-snippet name="Antlers Blade Components example" lang="blade">
    <s:collection from="pages" limit="2" sort="title:desc">
        {{ $title }}
    </s:collection>
</code-snippet>


### Control Panel
- The Control Panel is the primary way to create and manage content.
- Unless disabled or overridden, the Control Panel is usually accessible from `https://your-website.com/cp`.
- Super users can do and see everything, while non-super users can only do & see what their roles allow for.

### Extending Statamic
- You can either extend Statamic in the context of an application, or in the context of an addon.
- Addons are Composer packages, meaning they can be reused, distributed, or even sold to others later.
- There are a variety of ways you can extend Statamic: creating tags, fieldtypes, modifiers, etc. A lot of these things can be bootstrapped with `php please make:` commands.

#### Extending the Control Panel
- The Control Panel is built with Inertia.js and Vue 3.
- When running the `make:fieldtype` or `make:widget` commands, Statamic will install the necessary npm packages and configure Vite.
- Running `setup-cp-vite` in an application context will also do this for you. You'll be able to use `npm run cp:dev` and `npm run cp:build` to run Vite.
- You should use Statamic's UI Components where possible. It includes components for buttons, cards, inputs, etc.
    - UI Components can be imported from `@statamic/cms/ui`.
    - For more information on Statamic's UI Components, please visit our Storybook docs: https://ui.statamic.dev
